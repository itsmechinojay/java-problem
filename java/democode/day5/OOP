OOP
- Object-oriented Language
- based on the concept of objects - data and functions
- programming paradigm

4 Pillars of OOP
1) Encapsulation
    - data hiding
    - getters/setters
2) Inheritance
    - reusability
    - inherits the attribute and methods from a base class
3) Polymorphism
    - "many forms"
    - method overloading and overriding
        - overloading -> same method name but different parameters
        - overriding -> overrides existing implementation of a method from base class
4) Abstraction
    - implementation hiding

Class vs Object
- Class describes the data and functions of an object
- Object is based on the class

ClassName obj = new ClassName()
